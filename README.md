API Abuse &amp; Fraud Detection Platform Problem: 
APIs are increasingly the attack surface—scraping, bot abuse, fake signups, brute force, credential stuffing—but most SaaS products don’t have smart protection.  Solution:  Build a plug-and-play API abuse detection SaaS (like AbuseIPDB + Cloudflare but tailored for API endpoints)  Features: Rate-limiting heuristics, token anomaly detection, IP/device fingerprinting, geofencing, and AI-based behavior scoring  Bonus: Offer Laravel, Django, and Node.js middleware packages to make integration trivial
